# Loot Blare 1.1.12

Loot Blare is a World of Warcraft addon originally designed **Turtle WoW**.
This is a version edited to fit Kulový Blesk soft reserve system.

This addon displays a pop-up frame showing items and rolls when a single uncommon item is linked in Raid Warning. Rolls are automatically sorted by type to streamline the master looter's workflow. If the item as soft reserved the roll will have appropriate bonus added to it.

### Features:
#### Soft Reserve + import
  You can import your SR as a CSV file in this format:
  
  Name|Item|Points;
  Name|Item|Points;
  Name|Item|Points

#### Sync between addon users
  Master looter automatically syncs SR list between users using CHAT_MSG_ADDON events. SR list sync happens whenever the sr list is imported, new player joins the raid and player enters the instance. If a user comes 
  online after a disconnect they will automaticaly request a master looter and SR list sync.

#### Soft Reserve distinguishment
  Whenever someone rolls on SR their roll will be distinguished by a different colour

#### MS+1 (WIP)
  You can mark players in your raid with MS+1 through a table. If someone has some points they will be shown in the roll table.
